They consistently opposed the Iraq war, for example, which is now an extremely mainstream view. Obviously the Labour party is very down on the Iraq war these days but, crucially, that wasn’t the case when it was actually happening. At that point, both Labour and the Tories were all for it.</p>\n\n<p>The Lib Dems are also the only political group that’s consistently advocated proportional representation, and their failure to gain traction there may be the biggest disaster of the lot. It’s because of the first-past-the-post voting system that neither Labour nor the Conservative party can split without facing electoral annihilation. So Cameron called the Brexit referendum to keep the Tories together, and the majority of Labour MPs remain part of an organisation they believe to be ineptly or even malevolently led.</p>\n\n<p>The energy required to keep the Conservative and Labour parties ostensibly united is tearing Britain and Europe apart.

Also, thanks to the whole anti semitism, chances are, labour votes from Jewish communities are likely to head to the likes of the liberal democrats and even conservatives.</p>\n<p>If you thought the Cameron administration was bad, just look at Theresa May’s administration. The liberal democrats, for all their flaws did prevent some neoliberal (frankly insane) policies going through. </p>\n<p>Additionally, labour is messing up badly this election. How can you be in a close race with Theresa the-not-so-stable-May? Oh that’s right, labour has a watered down Tory Brexit policy, still supports restrictions on immigration, has blamed immigration and not to mention the fact his nationalisation plan comes at a time when the deficit as a % of GDP is growing. I’m actually really annoyed at Labour for failing to capitalise on the dreadful approval ratings.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a load of ridiculous bullshit. </p>\n<p>I can understand people not wanting to support Labour because of antisemitism. That’s about the only sensible thing in this response, although it should be added that voting Tory in response to concerns about racism is like smashing a window in protest against vandalism. </p>\n<p>The Liberal Democrats are not great on immigration. Their website currently has a document saying that the UK needs to “take back it’s borders.” Whilst making a vaguely positive case for immigration, the document also poses a number of further measures that should be imposed to discourage migrants and make it harder for people to settle permanently.

So crowing about them winning thousands of council seats conveniently leaves out that a significant chunk of those defences were holding safe seats they already had.<br/></li><li>The Conservative party is the party of government and is monumentally failing at basically everything, so Labour hyped the shit out of these elections promising to take Tory strongholds left right and centre, and they didn’t. They made too big a projection and fell short of it, failing to truly capitalise on the glaring failures of a hideous government and only making modest gains.<br/></li><li>Yes they got a hell of a good vote share, but in the 2017 snap election the Conservatives got the same vote share as Thatcher did in the 1983 election (42.4%, where the Tories won 397 seats) but still lost Theresa May her majority. Because FPTP is the worst and means the exact popular vote doesn’t mean as much as it should in terms of measuring actual progress.<br/></li><li>Their ‘historic best performance since 1971′ only really applies if you only count London councils, factoring in the rest of the UK they and the Tories both got 35% of the vote each so it’s not like being tied at the mid-30s with the Tories is some massive win.</li><li>If this was a general election they’d win more seats but still fall well clear of a majority, as mentioned, but this wasn’t a general election and any talk in that direction is purely hypothetical speculation because the next general election is both at most 4 years away and also fought on entirely different terms than local elections are.</li></ol><p>Look, Labour did pretty good. </p><p>I voted for them and I’m pleased with the results they achieved.

Also, thanks to the whole anti semitism, chances are, labour votes from Jewish communities are likely to head to the likes of the liberal democrats and even conservatives.</p>\n<p>If you thought the Cameron administration was bad, just look at Theresa May’s administration. The liberal democrats, for all their flaws did prevent some neoliberal (frankly insane) policies going through. </p>\n<p>Additionally, labour is messing up badly this election. How can you be in a close race with Theresa the-not-so-stable-May? Oh that’s right, labour has a watered down Tory Brexit policy, still supports restrictions on immigration, has blamed immigration and not to mention the fact his nationalisation plan comes at a time when the deficit as a % of GDP is growing. I’m actually really annoyed at Labour for failing to capitalise on the dreadful approval ratings.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a load of ridiculous bullshit. </p>\n<p>I can understand people not wanting to support Labour because of antisemitism. That’s about the only sensible thing in this response, although it should be added that voting Tory in response to concerns about racism is like smashing a window in protest against vandalism. </p>\n<p>The Liberal Democrats are not great on immigration. Their website currently has a document saying that the UK needs to “take back it’s borders.” Whilst making a vaguely positive case for immigration, the document also poses a number of further measures that should be imposed to discourage migrants and make it harder for people to settle permanently. The Lib Dems sees migrants as potential money makers, not as humans.  </p>\n<p>For all this nonsense talk of the Lib Dems holding back the Tories in coalition, they still supported the Immigration Act that has led to the current scandal. They still cosigned austerity which has had a disproportionate impact on people of colour and which has helped drive support for Brexit. And by signing up to the Tory view of the economy, they’ve helped convince people like you that we simply can’t afford the policies that are needed to save public services in this country.

So crowing about them winning thousands of council seats conveniently leaves out that a significant chunk of those defences were holding safe seats they already had.<br/></li><li>The Conservative party is the party of government and is monumentally failing at basically everything, so Labour hyped the shit out of these elections promising to take Tory strongholds left right and centre, and they didn’t. They made too big a projection and fell short of it, failing to truly capitalise on the glaring failures of a hideous government and only making modest gains.<br/></li><li>Yes they got a hell of a good vote share, but in the 2017 snap election the Conservatives got the same vote share as Thatcher did in the 1983 election (42.4%, where the Tories won 397 seats) but still lost Theresa May her majority. Because FPTP is the worst and means the exact popular vote doesn’t mean as much as it should in terms of measuring actual progress.<br/></li><li>Their ‘historic best performance since 1971′ only really applies if you only count London councils, factoring in the rest of the UK they and the Tories both got 35% of the vote each so it’s not like being tied at the mid-30s with the Tories is some massive win.</li><li>If this was a general election they’d win more seats but still fall well clear of a majority, as mentioned, but this wasn’t a general election and any talk in that direction is purely hypothetical speculation because the next general election is both at most 4 years away and also fought on entirely different terms than local elections are.</li></ol><p>Look, Labour did pretty good. </p><p>I voted for them and I’m pleased with the results they achieved.
